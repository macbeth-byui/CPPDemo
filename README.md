# Overview

This is a simple C++ demo that shows how to create a Class with a header file.  Demonstrations of creating objects and storing objects into a dynamic array (vector) is also done.

* `circle.h` - Specification of the Circle Class
* `circle.cpp` - Implementation of functions in the Circle Class
* `test.cpp` - Test code to demonstrate how the Circle class can be used to make objects

# Development Environment

You need to install a C++ compiler.  Options include:

* [Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/)
* [MingW Gnu Compiler](https://sourceforge.net/projects/mingw/)
* [CLion](https://www.jetbrains.com/clion/)

To build the software, open a terminal to compile.  I used the MingW Gnu Compiler which is shown below:

```
PS C:\git\CPPDemo> g++ *.cpp
PS C:\git\CPPDemo> ./a.exe
Circle Circle A has raidus 10
area = 314.159 circum = 62.8319
Circle Circle A has raidus 15
Circle Circle A has raidus 13.5
Circle Circle A has raidus 13.5
Circle Circle B has raidus 20
Circle Circle C has raidus 5.5
Circle Circle D has raidus 100
Circle Circle E has raidus 1
```
